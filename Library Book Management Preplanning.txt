Create 4 private instance variables: title, author, isAvailable, and times checked out
Default and some overloaded constructors 
Use arraylist to store objects 
3 methods: check in, check out, print available
Check in set isavailable to true
Check out will increases times check out and set isAvailable to false
Print will use enhanced for loop and if statement 
Prints the title and author
All good 👍
