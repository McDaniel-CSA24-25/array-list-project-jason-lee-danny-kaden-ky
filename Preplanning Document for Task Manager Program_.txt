Preplanning Document for Task Manager Program:


1. The Problem Definition and goals that needs to be addressed:
* Ask users what task they want to add in their list
* Ask users what task they want to remove in their list
* Display all their tasks at the end when demanded
* At the end, display the number or the list of task they would need to do
* BONUS: Ask user to add and manage what task are priorities


2. Requirements of the program:
* Use ArrayList<String> to store tasks.
* Add tasks with add().
* Remove tasks by index with remove(index).
* Display all tasks using a loop and get().
* Show total tasks with size().
* BONUS: Implement task prioritization


3. What methods or classes might be needed to implement:
* Class = taskManager
* Methods:
   * addTask(String task)
   * removeTask(int index)
   * displayTasks()
   * addPriorityTask()
   * groupingPriorityTask()


4. I didn’t use methods, but I did use a lot of variables and three ArrayList in order to separate the priority into High, Medium, and Low.
